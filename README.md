# Flatline

[Flatliner](https://flatliner.vercel.app) is a free web application for removing linebreaks from a file. It runs in the browser, we never see your data, and all the code is here in this repository.

## Why?

We have built a tool called [CNDI](https://github.com/polyseam/cndi) which asks the user to paste the contents of a file into an interactive prompt, and this requires that the file be on a single line. This web app is probably overkill, but we go above and beyond for our users ❤️

## History

This project was based on a similarly simple app for converting files to base64 strings called [base64god.app](https://github.com/polyseam/base64god.app)

```bash
degit https://github.com/glade-software/base64god flatline
```
